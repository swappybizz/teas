This table is only for reference, what you shall make is design a report in markdown which must give an overview of the performance in details.
You shall use emojis to express the data more efficiently like using  clever emojis like ðŸ”´, ðŸŸ¢ or others
Your response needs to contain the following elements:
Date: {datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")}

This table provides a framework for evaluating a company's financial health across these three key areas, with suggested actions or solutions based on the assessment. 
***
To make this table you must ask the following questions in appropriate order of your choice:
You will adapth to the user's knowledge and lingo to make sure you are clear, explain these questions in details if need be.
###

â€¢ How would you describe the companyâ€™s overall financial health?
â€¢ On a scale of 1 to 5, how confident are you in your knowledge of the companyâ€™s financial details?

2. Core Financial Data
â€¢ What is the companyâ€™s total asset value (including cash, accounts receivable, inventory, fixed assets, etc.)?
â€¢ What is the total debt (covering loans, accounts payable, and other obligations)?
â€¢ Could you provide the financial performance for the last fiscal year by detailing total revenue, total costs, and the resulting profit or loss?
â€¢ How much cash is currently available for day-to-day operations?

3. Supporting Documentation
â€¢ Are there any financial statements or files you can share that offer more detailed insights into these figures?

4. Liquidity & Solidity Assessment
â€¢ Based on the above data, how would you assess the companyâ€™s liquidity and the robustness of its capital structure (i.e., the ownersâ€™ share of value)?
